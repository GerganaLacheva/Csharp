//7.Vending Machine
//Until you receive "Start" you will be given different coins that are being inserted into the machine. You have to sum them to have the total money inserted. There is a problem though. 
//Your vending machine only works with 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 coins. If someone tries to insert some other coins you have to display "Cannot accept {money}" and not add it to the total money. 
//On the next few lines until you receive "End" you will be given products to purchase. Your machine has however only "Nuts", "Water", "Crisps", "Soda", "Coke". The prices are: 2.0, 0.7, 1.5, 0.8, 1.0 respectively.If the person tries to purchase a not existing product print "Invalid product". 
//Be careful that the person may try to purchase a product they donâ€™t have the money for. In that case, print "Sorry, not enough money". If the person purchases a product successfully print "Purchased {product name}". 
//After the "End" command print the money that is left formatted to the second decimal point in the format "Change: {money left}".
//Examples
//Input	Output
//1
//1
//0.5
//0.6
//Start
//Coke
//Soda
//Crisps
//End	Cannot accept 0.6
//Purchased coke
//Purchased soda
//Sorry, not enough money
//Change: 0.70
//1
//Start
//Nuts
//Coke
//End	Sorry, not enough money
//Purchased coke
//Change: 0.00
