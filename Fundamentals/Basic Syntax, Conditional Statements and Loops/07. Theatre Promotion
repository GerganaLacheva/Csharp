//7.Theatre Promotions
//A theatre is sail tickets at discount, and a program is needed to calculate the price of a single ticket. If the given age does not fit one of the categories, you should print "Error!".  
//The prices of the tickers are as follows:
//Day / Age   0 <= age <= 18  18 < age <= 64  64 < age <= 122
//Weekday 12$	18$	12$
//Weekend 15$	20$	15$
//Holiday 5$	12$	10$
//Input
//The input comes in two lines. On the first line, you will receive the type of day. On the second â€“ the age of the person.
//Output
//Print the price of the ticket according to the table, or "Error!" if the age is not in the table.
//Constraints
//â€¢	The age will be in the interval [-1000â€¦1000].
//â€¢	The type of day will always be valid. 
//Examples
//Input	Output		
//Weekday
//42	18$		Holiday
//-12	Error!		Holiday
//15	5$		Weekend
//122	15$
